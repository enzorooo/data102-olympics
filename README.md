# About
The project aims to predict the next top 10 Spotify songs based on Spotify Top 50 Charts and Music Features data. The charts data used in this project came from `SpotifyCharts.com` extracted using `BeautifulSoup`. While the music features of each song were extracted from `Spotify's WEBAPI` via `Spotipy`. The original dataset contained Top200 songs but were cut by the authors of this repository for the purpose of reducing computing requirements.
